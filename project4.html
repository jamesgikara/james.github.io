    <h2>AREA OF SHAPES</h2>
    <!-- Description of the project -->
    <p>Description: This project aims to calculate the areas of various geometric shapes. Users can input the dimensions of shapes such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and squares, and the application will calculate their respective areas.</p>
    <!-- Contribution section -->
    <p>Contribution: My contribution to this project involved developing the frontend user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I implemented the input forms for users to input shape dimensions and designed the layout for presenting the calculated areas. Additionally, I collaborated with team members to integrate the frontend with backend functionalities for accurate area calculations.</p>
